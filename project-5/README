This program process a series of commands for controlling a robot's movement on a grid. The commands are provided as a multiline string named `commands`. 
The robot's position and direction are tracked using the `position` and `direction` variables. The script includes the `exec_command` function, which interprets and executes the commands to move the robot.
The script parses the multiline command string, executing each command line by line. 
The command lines consist of instructions to set the initial position and direction of the robot, move it, and change its direction. 
The robot's movement is constrained by the grid boundaries defined by `X` and `Y`.
To use the script, you can modify the `commands` variable with your desired commands, and the script will process them accordingly. This code is a basic implementation of a command interpreter for a simple robot, allowing you to experiment with different movement scenarios and grid boundaries.
